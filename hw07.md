# 我的第七次作业  

## 第一部分-解答
1、Program with machine language according to the following c.  
int_8 a = 1;  
int_8 c = a + 3;  
1）Write your assembly code & machine code  
（X86):  
a db 0  
c db 0  
mov al, 1    
mov a, al  //a = 1  
add al, 3  
mov c, al  //c = a+3   
   
(PL/0):  
 LOD #1  
 STO X  
 LOD X  
 ADD #3  
 STO Y  
 HLT  

（机器语言）:  
00010100  00000001  
00000101  10000001  
00010100  10000001   
00010000  00000011  
00000100  10000002  
00001111  00000000  

2）Explain machine code execution with the fetch-decode-execute cycle  
Main memory–>fetch instruction–>Decode instruction–>Registers –>Get data–>Execute the instruction–> Main memory  
3）Explain functions about IR, PC, ACC registers in a CPU  
IR: 指令寄存器，临时放置从内存里面取得的代码数据(也就是指令)  
PC：程序计数器，用来指示下一条指令的地址(逻辑地址即偏移量)  
ACC： 累加器A的缩写，累加器A是一个具有特殊用途的二进制8位寄存器，专门用来存放操作数或运算结果。在CPU执行某种运算前，两个操作数中的一个通常应放在累加器A中，运算完成后累加器A中便可得到运算结果。  
4）Explain physical meaning about vars a & c in a machine  
在内存中申请一块内存作为a和c的空间  

## 第二部分-简答
1）What are stored in memory?  
指令和数据  
2）Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place?  
可以  
3） Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.  
ADD X: 0000000 bbbbbbbb  
前八位是命令指示，后八位是操作数，其中第四位为寻址方式，五到八为为操作码

## 第三部分-名词解释  
1）汇编语言（Assembly Language）  
An assembly (or assembler) language, often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.  
2）编译（Compiler）  
A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program. A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers.  
3）命令式语言（Imperative programming）  
In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.  
4）函数编程语言（Functional programming）  
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x produces the same result f(x) each time; this is in contrast to procedures depending on a local or global state, which may produce different results at different times when called with the same arguments but a different program state. Eliminating side effects, i.e., changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.  
5）过程式编程（Procedural programming）  
Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. The first major procedural programming languages first appeared circa 1960, including Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL and BASIC. Pascal and C were published closer to the 1970s.
